Main.js ->

why we have to write $(start) to kick off the app. is it just another way of start()?

Story.js ->

Li items are being created with 2 icon tags, why?

for that reason when I toggleFavorite()

-> there's a small bug on their code , that if you are not logged in , the app will load
stories without the star which is fine, but after creating a new user or login in,
the storylist still wont have star. 

To fix it, we will empty the list and get a new list.
